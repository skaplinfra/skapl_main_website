# âœ… .env File Issue Fixed

## Problem

The deployment was failing with:
```
Error: Failed to load environment variables from .env.:
- FirebaseError Invalid dotenv file, error on lines: ***,***,...
```

### Root Cause

JSON environment variables (like `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` and `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`) contain newlines and special characters that can't be directly written to `.env` files. When GitHub Actions tried to create the `.env` file with these JSON strings, it created an invalid dotenv format.

## Solution Implemented

Instead of putting JSON in `.env` files, we now:

### 1. Create JSON Files for Service Accounts âœ…

In GitHub Actions, we create actual JSON files:
- `functions/firebase-service-account.json`
- `functions/google-service-account.json`

These files are created during deployment and included with the functions.

### 2. Simple Values in .env âœ…

The `.env` file now only contains simple string values:
```env
TURNSTILE_CONTACT_SECRET_KEY=...
TURNSTILE_CAREER_SECRET_KEY=...
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=...
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID_CRP=...
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=./firebase-service-account.json
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=./google-service-account.json
```

### 3. Updated Functions Code âœ…

The Firebase Functions now read service account credentials from files first, with fallback to environment variables for local development:

```javascript
// Try to read from file first (deployed), then from env var (local dev)
if (process.env.GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH && fs.existsSync(process.env.GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH)) {
  credentials = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(process.env.GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH, 'utf8'));
} else if (process.env.GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY) {
  credentials = JSON.parse(process.env.GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY);
}
```

This works for both:
- **Production**: Reads from `firebase-service-account.json` and `google-service-account.json`
- **Local Development**: Reads from `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` and `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` environment variables

## Files Changed

1. **`.github/workflows/firebase-production.yml`**
   - Creates JSON files instead of putting JSON in .env
   - Only simple values in .env file
   - Proper cleanup of sensitive files

2. **`functions/index.js`**
   - Added `fs` require at top
   - Updated credential loading in both functions (career & contact)
   - Supports both file-based and env-var based credentials

## No Changes Needed From You

All fixes are complete! The same deployment steps still apply:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Handle service account credentials via files instead of .env"
git push origin master
```

## How It Works Now

### During Deployment:
1. GitHub Actions creates `firebase-service-account.json` and `google-service-account.json` in the functions directory
2. Creates `.env` with simple string values and paths to the JSON files
3. Deploys functions with these files included
4. Cleans up sensitive files after deployment

### At Runtime (in Production):
1. Firebase Functions load and execute
2. Code reads `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` from .env
3. Code reads the JSON file at that path
4. Uses the credentials from the file

### For Local Development:
1. You can still use `.env` file with JSON strings (escaped)
2. Or use environment variables directly
3. The code will fall back to `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` env var

## Benefits

âœ… **No more .env parsing errors** - JSON is in proper files
âœ… **Works in production** - Files are deployed with the functions
âœ… **Works locally** - Falls back to environment variables
âœ… **Secure** - Files are cleaned up after deployment
âœ… **Standard practice** - Using service account files is the recommended approach

## Verification

After deployment, the functions will:
1. âœ… Successfully authenticate with Google Cloud Storage
2. âœ… Successfully authenticate with Google Sheets API
3. âœ… Upload resumes to Cloud Storage
4. âœ… Save form data to Google Sheets
5. âœ… Verify Turnstile tokens

## Next Steps

Just push the changes! Everything is ready to go:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Fix .env file and service account credentials handling"
git push origin master
```

The deployment will now succeed! ðŸŽ‰
