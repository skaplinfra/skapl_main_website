# ðŸš€ Quick Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Response Cloning Bug âœ…
**Problem**: Response body was consumed before cloning, causing error:
```
Failed to execute 'clone' on 'Response': Response body is already used
```

**Fixed**: `lib/clientApi.ts` - Response is now cloned before consumption

### 2. API Routes Not Working in Production âœ…
**Problem**: Static export sites can't use Next.js API routes, causing:
```
Failed to parse JSON response: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```

**Fixed**: Created Firebase Functions to handle API endpoints

### 3. Turnstile 401 Errors âœ…
**Problem**: Turnstile verification was failing

**Fixed**: Proper server-side verification in Firebase Functions
